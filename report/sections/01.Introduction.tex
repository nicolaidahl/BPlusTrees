% Notes:
% Implement BPlusTree in Gallina
% What are we going to prove?
% We use Coq
In the following report we discuss the implementation and formal proof of an inherently imperative data structure, B+ tree, in a pure functional language, Galina, using the Coq interactive proof assistant. B+ trees are used in many commercial database and file systems\,\cite[p. 359]{ramakrishnan2003database}, and are characterized by their low height and high fan-out, lessening the number of IO operations needed when reading from disk\,\cite[pp. 344]{ramakrishnan2003database}.
\paragraph{}
We will present an inductively defined data type describing a B+ tree, and formulate the various propositions needed to reason about it. Based on this data type, we will implement $search$ and $insert$ functions, and partially prove their correctness. Earlier work\,\cite{sexton2008reasoning} has reasoned about B+ using separation logic, but to our knowledge, no one has produced a complete proof of correctness for a B+ tree implementation. While this is not the aim of this project, it serves as a foundation for a complete proof.
\paragraph{Outline}
First, in Section \ref{sec:Background} we explain the data structure in question. Section \ref{sec:ProblemAnalysis} gives a problem analysis focused on the implementation of this data structure with its core operations, when proving these is an obligation. The various strategies and difficulties when proving the main operations are covered in Section \ref{sec:ProofRealization}. Finally, Section \ref{sec:Conclusion} concludes the report.

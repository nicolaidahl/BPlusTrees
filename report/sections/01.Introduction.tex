% Notes:
% Implement BPlusTree in Gallina
% What are we going to prove?
% We use Coq
In the following report we discuss the implementation and formal proof of an inherently imperative data structure, B+ tree, in a pure functional language, Galina. 
\paragraph{}
First, in Section \ref{sec:Background} we explain the data structure in question. Section \ref{sec:ProblemAnalysis} gives a problem analysis focused on the implementation of this data structure with its core operations, when proving these is an obligation. The various strategies and difficulties when proving the main operations are covered in Section \ref{sec:ProofRealization}. Finally, Section \ref{sec:Conclusion} concludes the report.
